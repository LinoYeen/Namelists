If anyone get's on false-positives.txt it could be because they have gotten put on it by accident in the past 
Some usernames are grabbed by HackBolts false positives ( I will be looking for appeals )
If you need to appeal yourself please use the google form makes it 1000% easier for me.

Namelist has names of bots ( normally accounts made within a short period of time with similar names, comprimsed accounts,
malicious users and or follow bots. ) All accounts submitted will be added in after review.

All Namelists/false-positives are [0-9 A-Z] format

Accounts that are banned from Twitch completely will be removed from the list so it shortens it.

All false-positives are removed from namelist.txt
All false-positives found are moved onto this list


Need a faster way to do all the bans and unbans? I recommend my friends tool
https://github.com/pixelsuchter/bantool-2

My settings for this tool ^

{
  "Ban": true,
  "Block": false,
  "Chunk size": 10000,
  "Firefox_profile": "8ztl0cuq.BanTool",
  "Greeting Emote": "",
  "Number_of_browser_windows": 4,
  "Unban": true,
  "Unblock": false,
  "account_name": "linoyeen",
  "twitch_channels": [ "linoyeen" ]
}
