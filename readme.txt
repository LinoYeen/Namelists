If anyone get's on false-positives.txt it could be because they have gotten put on it by accident in the past

( I will not be in town till Oct 1st I will not have access to my PC so editing of list will not be possible )

Namelist has names of bots ( normally accounts made within a short period of time with similar names, comprised accounts,
malicious users and or follow bots. ) All accounts submitted will be added in after review.

All Namelists/false-positives are [0-9 A-Z] format

Accounts that are banned from Twitch completely will be removed from the list so it shortens it.

All false-positives are removed from namelist.txt
All false-positives found are moved onto this list

pending.txt is for accounts that are found with similarities
such as Name and Account creation being too close to eachother ect.

Automatic banning/blocking found here : https://www.twitch.tv/sery_bot

Need a faster way to do all the bans and unbans? I recommend my friends tool
https://github.com/pixelsuchter/bantool-2

My settings for this tool ^

{
  "Ban": true,
  "Block": false,
  "Chunk size": 10000,
  "Firefox_profile": "8ztl0cuq.BanTool",
  "Greeting Emote": "",
  "Number_of_browser_windows": 4,
  "Unban": true,
  "Unblock": false,
  "account_name": "linoyeen",
  "twitch_channels": [ "linoyeen" ]
}

Only change Block/unblock to true if you've been follow botted.
This should remove them after me adding them to the list if you submitted them

YouTube Video of how to setup FYI I don't do YouTube so if I messed up it is probably since I had
a lot to do in a short amount of time since how many have asked me to make a youtube video about
setting up the tool. I edited and recorded after being awake for over 25 hours. ( that's my fault )
Tutorial to set it up is here : https://youtu.be/Sd8mWQzEW5E

I also voting on this for moderation tools for api calls for bans/unbans to the chatroom

Completely volentary ( Only adding since I was asked to put this here )
This isn't required at all but here is this since I do take a time out of my day to update these lists often.
